Homework: Multidimensional Arrays
Problem 1. Fill the matrix

Write a program that fills and prints a matrix of size (n, n) as shown below:
Example for n=4:

a)	b)	c)	d)*
1	5	9	13
2	6	10	14
3	7	11	15
4	8	12	16
1	8	9	16
2	7	10	15
3	6	11	14
4	5	12	13
7	11	14	16
4	8	12	15
2	5	9	13
1	3	6	10
1	12	11	10
2	13	16	9
3	14	15	8
4	5	6	7
Problem 2. Maximal sum

Write a program that reads a rectangular matrix of size N x M and finds in it the square 3 x 3 that has maximal sum of its elements.
Problem 3. Sequence n matrix

We are given a matrix of strings of size N x M. Sequences in the matrix we define as sets of several neighbour elements located on the same line, column or diagonal.
Write a program that finds the longest sequence of equal strings in the matrix.
Example:

matrix	result		matrix	result
ha	fifi	ho	hi
fo	ha	hi	xx
xxx	ho	ha	xx
ha, ha, ha		
s	qq	s
pp	pp	s
pp	qq	s
s, s, s
Problem 4. Binary search

Write a program, that reads from the console an array of N integers and an integer K, sorts the array and using the method Array.BinSearch() finds the largest number in the array which is = K.
Problem 5. Sort by string length

You are given an array of strings. Write a method that sorts the array by the length of its elements (the number of characters composing them).
Problem 6.* Matrix class

Write a class Matrix, to hold a matrix of integers. Overload the operators for adding, subtracting and multiplying of matrices, indexer for accessing the matrix content and ToString().
Problem 7.* Largest area in matrix

Write a program that finds the largest area of equal neighbour elements in a rectangular matrix and prints its size.
Example:

matrix	result
1	3	2	2	2	4
3	3	3	2	4	4
4	3	1	2	3	3
4	3	1	3	3	1
4	3	3	3	1	1
13
Hint: you can use the algorithm Depth-first search or Breadth-first search.
